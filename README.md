## Introduction

Using supervised learning, in this project, predicting wine quality from the dataset that has been made available by Cortez. et Al from 2009. The dataset can be found from the citations
folder. Throughout this project, we use different python libraries such as `pandas` for parsing and working with the datset, `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for using it for plotting, and
`numpy` for working with the data. 

For the machine learning aspect, the models were taken from `sklearn` and they have been trained on the dataset as mentioned above.

We will build a supervised machine learning model to predict the color of wines whether the wine is white or red in color

## Usage

The code is stored as a `jupyter` notebook. To run the code, please open the file in jupyter and use run all command to run the code.
