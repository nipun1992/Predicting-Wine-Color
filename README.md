## Introduction

Created Machine Learning models to predict color of wine from the wine dataset. The dataset can be found from the citations folder. In this project, I have used python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn. 

## Directory structure

The code is stored as a jupyter notebook Wine **quality Prediction-checkpoint.ipynb** inside **src** folder. To run the code, please open the file in jupyter and use run all command to run the code. The data is present at **src/data** location.

## Findings

#### Count vs Quality
The below represents that in the dataset we have more average quality wines rather than the low/bad or high/good quality wine. A general observation, of a Gaussian distribution trend can be seen in the data.

### Correlation with Heatmap

In the heatmap, if there are any 2 independent features that are highly correlated i.e. 80% or more, then we can drop 1 of those 2 features because both those features are serving the same purpose. We can see that density and 'residual sugar' features have a `pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83` i.e. *83% and thus we can drop 1 of these 2 features*. But in the dataset of red wines, these 2 features are not strongly correlated and thus we cannot drop 1 amongst these 2 features from the red wine dataset.

Hence, We retained the features.

## Conclusion
