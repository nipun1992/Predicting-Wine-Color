## Overview

The problem statement is regarding wine color prediction.

Supervised classification Machine Learning models have been built to perform the binary classification between white and red wines.
## About the Dataset

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saigeethac/red-and-white-wine-quality-datasets?select=winequality-white.csv

Abstract: Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

Data Set Information:
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

Attribute Information:
Variables (based on physicochemical tests):

- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality (score between 0 and 10)
- color (red and white)
## Directory structure

The code is stored as a jupyter notebook **Wine_color_prediction.ipynb**
